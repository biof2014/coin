## Coin Flipping

Let's create a simulation model for sampling sequence of coin flips 
and tallying the number of heads. Through this exercise, we will illustrate
how a random variable can be implemented explicitly in R.

We will

1. Generate the sample space
2. Define the random variable
3. Calculate the induced probability function on the random variable
4. Sample from the sample space and output a realization of the random
   variable

Code your implementation in the template `coin.R`.
